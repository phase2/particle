    summary:
      These patterns are used for any valid HTML form element. Input styling is
      targetted against the input <code>type</code> attribute. <br> How an
      <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> works varies considerably depending on the
      value of its type attribute, hence the different types are covered in
      their own separate reference pages. If this attribute is not html5ified,
      the default type adopted is text.
