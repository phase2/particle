## Configuration

It's almost all done in `gulpconfig.yml`. End all paths with a `/` please (i.e. `path/to/dir/`). The local `gulpfile.js` passes the `config` object to [`p2-theme-core`](https://github.com/phase2/p2-theme-core) - which can be viewed at `node_modules/p2-theme-core/` (most stuff in `lib/`).

Many of the features can be turned off, for example if we didn't want all the JS features like linting and concatenation, just toggle `enabled` under `js` in `gulpconfig.yml`. So you'd just open `gulpconfig.yml` and change this:

```diff
js:
-    enabled: true
+    enabled: false
```

Documentation for many of the features are found in `node_modules/p2-theme-core/docs/` – those are [hosted here](http://p2-theme-core.readthedocs.org) too.

### Linting Config

- JS: edit `.eslintrc` - [rule docs](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/)
- Scss: edit `.sass-lint.yml` - [rule docs](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint/tree/master/docs/rules)

### Babel JS Transpiling Config

Edit `.babelrc` for configuration of [Babel rules](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/options/) that transpile JS. Default allows ES6 to be transpiled to ES5. Learn about awesome [ES6 features](http://es6-features.org) here.
