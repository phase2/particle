# SVG Pattern

The SVG is a special pattern in Particle that is designed to allow us to include
SVG as CSS or inline. Furthermore, this pattern is setup to be optimized as a
developer step via `npm run fmt:svg` or `npm run fmt`.

## Adding SVG

To add an SVG to the system, simply add it to `@atoms/svg/icons/` directory and
run the format command. This step is **destructive**, so be aware of using
source control to revert unintended changes.

## Adjusting Formatting Configuration

This pattern uses [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) to format and optimize SVG
files. You can adjust the configuration at Particle's root in `/.svgo.yml`.
