//
// Global VARIABLES and HELPERS
//
// Place global config here like Bootstrap's _variables.scss.
// This kind of config is often required prior to importing any libraries
// (ie Bootstrap Sass), and does not produce any CSS, just variables and maps.
//
// This file is provided AUTOMATICALLY to every .scss file on the dependency
// chain via the configuration of the sass-loader within particle.js.
// In other words, every .scss within Particle has `@import 00-protons/variables`
// silently injected into the first line.
//
// As long as everything within this files DOES NOT PRINT CSS, there will be
// no duplicated output. Again, for the people in the back:
//
// THIS FILE CONTAINS ONLY NON-PRINTING SASS, LIKE VARIABLES, MIXINS, & FUNCTIONS
//

// Custom non-printing tools
@import 'non-printing/functions';
@import 'non-printing/colors';
@import 'non-printing/mixins';

// (Other non-printing .scss), ie font families, spacing, etc
$spacing: (
  s: 5px,
  m: 25px,
  l: 50px,
);

// This is a good place to globally override bootstrap variables that aren't
// just overridden in a component later on.

// Bootstrap non-printing tools
@import '~bootstrap/scss/functions';
@import '~bootstrap/scss/variables';
@import '~bootstrap/scss/mixins';

// import anything else non-printing that may depend on variables in this file!
// @import 'non-printing/project-specific-mixins'

// Generated SVG icons and sprite mixins
@import '01-atoms/svgicon/scss/_icons-generated';

// Font Awesome tools
@import '~font-awesome/scss/variables';
@import '~font-awesome/scss/mixins';
