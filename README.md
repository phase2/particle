# Pattern Lab Starter

## Super Quick Setup

Use our [Yeoman Generator](https://github.com/phase2/generator-pattern-lab-starter) for the best way to spin this up for your project. Directly cloning and working on this repo is for contributors. 

### Prerequesites 

You'll need [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and ruby.

```bash
npm install --global grunt-cli bower yeoman
gem install bundler
npm install --global generator-pattern-lab-starter
```

### Spinning it up

```bash
yo pattern-lab-starter
yo pattern-lab-starter:extras # optional extras
```

## install and setup
    
After cloning and changing into that directory, run this to install dependencies:

    npm install
    bower install
    bundle install

You may have to run that again for updates; so it may be wise to save this: `npm install && bower install && bundler install`. **If you have any problems; this is the first thing to run.**


If you want to use this for another project and want to add it to a different git repo; simply run:

    rm -rf .git/

## Assets (CSS & JS)

To add either CSS or JS to Pattern Lab, use one of these methods:

### Bower

Installing any [Bower](http://bower.io) component with the `--save` or `--save-dev` flag will get the `main` asset's `<link>` or `<script>` tags added to Pattern Lab automatically via [wiredep](https://github.com/taptapship/wiredep). So, you can search for [anything that Bower can install](http://bower.io/search/) and run:

    bower install {thing} --save

### Adding direct paths

Adding paths to `pattern-lab-assets.yml` will get the CSS or JS added to Pattern Lab.

### Editing the head or foot partial

If you want the most direct access, which the two above methods inject into, then just head to one of these files:

- `pattern-lab/source/_patterns/00-atoms/00-meta/_00-head.mustache`
- `pattern-lab/source/_patterns/00-atoms/00-meta/_01-foot.mustache`

## Visual Regression Testing

**New Feature in Testing**

- To run all visual regression tests, execute `grunt regressionQA`
- To configure, edit `grunt-tasks/regression-qa/regression-qa.js`
- To create new tests, duplicate the approach seen with files that end in `*.test.js` in `pattern-lab/source/_patterns/`
- If you made an intentional change and are getting a failed test (because something did intentionally visually change), you need to run this from next to the `*.test.js` file:

```bash
# Assuming our test is called `atoms-buttons`
# Delete our screen shot of the former known good
rm baselines/atoms-buttons.png
# Move the screen shot of the new current state into the baseline folder and rename it
mv results/atoms-buttons.diff.png baselines/atoms-buttons.png
```

### `grunt testClean` task

You can all clear all baselines out and start over by basically saying that: how the site looks now is what I want future tests to compare against by running this:

```bash
grunt testClean:all
```

Additionally, individual components can be targeted by running this:

```bash
grunt testClean:name-of-test
```

### `grunt test` task 

Can accept two params:

- `tests`: If this param is blank then a server is spun up and all tests are run. If a value is passed (i.e. `featured-item`) then `featured-item-test.js` is run by itself. Much quicker than waiting for all tests.
- `new`: If `new` is passed in to the second param, then the associated baselines for the selected test file is deleted before running

```bash
grunt test
grunt test:*
grunt test:featured-item:new
```

## Configuration

The main configuration file for the whole project is `Gruntconfig.yml`; you'll find several important settings there, such as:

- directories and paths for scss, pattern lab, and javascript
- local server settings

`Gruntconfig.yml` is commited with the project and shared between members of the team; however individuals can create a file called `Gruntconfig--custom.yml` and override specific values there – that file is ignored by git so it can be customized per person (for example, some people like to set `openBrowserAtStart` to false).

There are many different pieces of tech and many files that set the preferences for each of them. Here's a list of them and where to find the config file for each.

- Compass/Sass: `config.rb` - [docs](http://compass-style.org/help/documentation/configuration-reference/)
- Bundler (Ruby Gem Versions): `Gemfile` - [docs](http://bundler.io)
- Pattern Lab: `pattern-lab/config/config.ini` - [docs](http://patternlab.io/docs/advanced-config-options.html)
- Grunt: `Gruntfile.js` and `package.json` - [docs](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks)
- Bower (library management): `bower.json` and `.bowerrc` - [docs](http://bower.io/)

## Conventions

- Relative links instead of root relative links for paths (where possible) i.e. use `../images/logo.png` instead of `/images/logo.png`
- All directory variables have trailing slash like this: `../path/to/dir/` - this allows us to set it to `./` and have it all be relative to Gruntfile
- Use camelCase for naming
- Use code comments todos on the same line or above issue like this: // @todo Example Todo Message
- Grunt plugins config object should have a comment to the docs URL

## Pattern Lab Terms

- **Atoms** are basic tags, such as form labels, inputs or buttons. They also include more abstract elements like color palettes, fonts, and animations.
- **Molecules** are groups of elements that function together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, and button atom can combine them together to form a search form molecule.
- **Organisms** can consist of similar and/or disparate molecule types. For example, a masthead organism might consist of a logo, navigation, and search form, while a “product grid” organism might consist of the same product info molecule repeated over and over.
- **Templates** are comprised mostly of organisms combined together to form page-level objects. Templates mostly focus on content structure (such as character length, image size, etc) rather than the actual content.
- **Pages** are specific instances of templates and swap out placeholder content with real representative content.
