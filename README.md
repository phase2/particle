# Particle: A design system integrating to Pattern Lab and a Drupal 8 theme

[![GitHub (pre-)release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/phase2/particle/all.svg)](https://github.com/phase2/particle/releases) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/phase2/particle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/phase2/particle) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/phase2/particle.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

![Particle mascot: Astrogoat](source/_patterns/01-atoms/image/demo/astrogoat.png?raw=true "Astrogoat")

Particle is an opinionated set of tools and examples to:

1. Build an application-agnostic **design system**
1. Apply that design system to a locally-served **Pattern Lab** for rapid prototyping
1. Apply that design system to a **Drupal theme**

In depth documentation about frontend approach using this project at [Phase2 Frontend Docs](https://phase2.github.io/frontend-docs/)

## Prerequisites

- [Node `^8.0.0`](https://nodejs.org)
- [PHP `5.6`, `^7.0.0`](https://php.net)
- [Composer `^1.0.0`](https://getcomposer.org)

## Provides

- Drupal theme, Grav theme,  and Pattern Lab app
- Strict [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) component structure
- Webpack bundling of all CSS, javascript, font, and static image assets for multiple targets (Drupal theme, Grav theme, Pattern Lab)
- [Webpack Dev Server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) for local hosting and hot reloading of assets into Pattern Lab
- [Twig namespaced paths](https://symfony.com/doc/current/templating/namespaced_paths.html) automatically added into Drupal theme and Pattern Lab config. Within any twig file, `@atoms/thing.twig` means the same thing to Drupal theme and Pattern Lab.
- Iconfont auto-generation
- Bootstrap 4 integration, used for all starting example components
- Auto-linting against the [AirBnB JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and sane Sass standards
- All Webpack and Gulp files are fully configurable

## Quickstart

Particle builds design systems in dev mode for local hosting, or production mode for optimized asset generation.

### Quickstart anywhere

1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/phase2/particle/releases)
1. Extract anywhere (i.e. this readme should be at `any/where/particle/README.md`)
1. Within the extracted folder run:

```bash
npm install
npm run setup
npm start
```

Simply wait until the webpack bundle output appears then visit [http://0.0.0.0:8080/pl](http://0.0.0.0:8080/pl) (or [http://localhost:8080/pl](http://localhost:8080/pl)) and start working.

### Quickstart with Drupal 8

Particle provides a Drupal 8 theme, the starting steps are slightly different:

1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/phase2/particle/releases)
1. Extract to `themes/` at the root of your Drupal 8 install. (i.e. this readme should be at `{drupal-root}/themes/particle/README.md`)
1. Download and install the [Component Libraries module](https://www.drupal.org/project/components):

    ```bash
    # With Drush
    drush dl components
    drush en components -y

    # With Drupal Console
    drupal module:install components
    ```

1. Within `{drupal-root}/themes/particle/` run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run setup
    npm run build:drupal
    ```

This will compile all assets and provide all namespaced Twig paths to the Drupal theme. Make sure to choose this theme in Drupal Appearance settings and `drush cr ` or `drupal cr all` to clear cache.

For subsequent recompile and Drupal cache clear, run:

```bash
npm run build:drupal && drush cr
```

Working rapidly in Pattern Lab is still available, simply run:

```bash
npm start
```

Just like in the regular Quickstart, when Webpack output appears, visit [http://0.0.0.0/pl](http://0.0.0.0/pl) (or [http://localhost/pl](http://localhost/pl)) to immediately start building and previewing your design system in Pattern Lab.

That's it. For **much** greater detail on the frontend approach using this project, check out the [Phase2 Frontend Docs](https://phase2.github.io/frontend-docs/).

## Structure

The following are significant items at the root level:

    # ./
    .
    ├── apps                           # Things that use the compiled design system. Drupal theme & PL
    ├── dist                           # Bundled output: CSS, js, images, app artifacts (like PL html)
    ├── source                         # The design system. All assets compiled to dist/
    ├── tools                          # Gulp plugins and node tools

    └── ...                            # Mostly just config

`source/` holds all assets for the design system and looks like this:

    # ./source/
    .

    └── design-system.js               # The ultimate importer/exporter of the design system pieces

>The design system is *consumed by* "apps". The three apps included are a Drupal theme, Grav theme, and a Pattern Lab installation.

`apps/pl/` holds the *entry point* for all Pattern Lab assets, as well as the PHP engine:

    # ./app/pl/
    .
    ├── pattern-lab/                   # Holds the Pattern Lab installation
    │   ├── ...                        # composer.json, config, console php, ...

    └── index.js                       # Imports and applies the design system to a bundle for PL

`apps/drupal/` holds the *entry point* for all Drupal 8 theme assets, as well as templates, yml, etc:

    # ./app/drupal/
    .
    ├── scss/                          # Theme-only Sass, tweaks to Drupalisms that need not be in the DS

## Anatomy of a Component

All components require a set of files:

    # ./source/_patterns/01-atoms/button/
    .
    ├── __tests__                      # Jest unit tests. Read automatically during `npm run test:unit`
    │   └── button.test.js             # Unit test JS functions. Limited DOM manipulation
    ├── demo                           # Demo implementations, can be removed on deploy to prod
    │   ├── buttons.md                 # Markdown with extra notes, visible in PL UI
    │   ├── buttons.twig               # Demonstrate with a plural name, visible to PL since no underscore
    │   └── buttons.yml                # Data provided to the demo pattern
    ├── _button.scss                   # Most components require styles, underscore required
    ├── _button.twig                   # The pure component template, "_" required to hide from PL UI
    └── index.js                       # Component entry point

With the power of [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), all static assets a component needs are `import`ed right into the `index.js` **entry point** alongside the javascript methods:

```javascript
// source/_patterns/01-atoms/button/index.js

// Import *EVERY* NPM dependency.
import $ from 'jquery';
// Import specific plugins this component may need
import 'bootstrap/js/src/button';

// source/_patterns/01-atoms/00-protons/index.js
import 'protons';

// Import local Sass (which in turn imports Bootstrap Sass)
import './_button.scss';

// Requirement 1 of a component: name
export const name = 'button';

// Requirement 2 of a component: disable function
export function disable() {}

// Requirement 3 of a component: enable function. `$context` is `$(document)` in PL, and `context` in Drupal
export function enable($context) {

  // `.button()` is only available because of `import 'bootstrap/js/src/button';` above
  $('#blah', $context).button('toggle');
}

// Req. 4 of a component: default export is the enable function
export default enable;
```

See the Sass and Twig sections below for more

## Sass

Particle makes a very clear distinction between *printing* and *non-printing* Sass in components.

> Printing Sass generates actual, rendered CSS output.

This results in rendered CSS:

```scss
.thing {
  background: blue;
}
```

> Non-printing Sass results in no CSS

This won't output any CSS:

```scss
$rando-var: 33px;
@mixin doThing() {
  background: blue;
}
```

There is a distinct role for each in the component system of Particle. In the `button` component featured above in [Anatomy of a Component](#anatomy-of-a-component), note this import:

```javascript
// source/_patterns/01-atoms/button/_index.js
...
import './_button.scss';
...

```

Looking into `source/_patterns/01-atoms/button/_button.scss` reveals:

```scss
@import '../../00-protons/config'; // DOES NOT OUTPUT CSS!

$btn-border-radius: 0.25rem;
@import "~bootstrap/scss/buttons"; // OUTPUTS CSS!

.custom-class {
  color: red;    // OUTPUTS CSS!
}
```

This approach to component styes allows sharing non-printing Sass **configuration**, while also ensuring our component prints its custom CSS exactly once. We can now safely `@import 'atoms/button;` anywhere in our other javascript components as many times as needed and there will be no duplicate CSS output for buttons!

## Twig

Twig notes coming soon.

## Javascript

All javascript should be written in ES6 (ES2015) according to the [AirBnB JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). Webpack will use Babel to transpile all javascript back to ES5 in emitted bundles.

## Atomic Design and Namespaces

"Namespaces" are simply aliases to paths on a file system. The design system within `source/` adheres strongly to [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/), with `@protons` added on.

| Path                             | Twig         | Javascript  | Sass |
| -------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ---- |
| `source/_patterns/00-protons/`   | `@protons`   | `protons`   | TBD
| `source/_patterns/01-atoms/`     | `@atoms`     | `atoms`     | TBD
| `source/_patterns/02-molecules/` | `@molecules` | `molcules`  | TBD
| `source/_patterns/03-organisms/` | `@organisms` | `organisms` | TBD
| `source/_patterns/04-templates/` | `@templates` | `templates` | TBD
| `source/_patterns/05-pages/`     | `@pages`     | `pages`     | TBD

> Note: Namespaces within Sass are a work in progress!

Our reasoning for categorization of components within each is pretty close to pure Atomic Design principals, but here's a quick explanation.

- **Protons** features Sass systems and non-consumable pattern markup. No Twig file will `@include` anything from @protons, but javascript and Sass will. This is a uniquely Particle convention.
- **Atoms** upward **will** be included in other Twig files.

    > "Atoms of our interfaces serve as the foundational building blocks that comprise all our user interfaces. These atoms include basic HTML elements like form labels, inputs, buttons, and others that can’t be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional. [Source.](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#atoms)
- **Molecules** are more complex widgets that must at least include an atom and sometimes other molecules.

  > "In interfaces, molecules are relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, and button can join together to create a search form molecule." [Source.](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#molecules)
- **Organisms** feature atoms, molecules, and even other organisms (sparingly). Think headers, footers, blog rolls.

  > "Organisms are relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms." [Source.](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#organisms)
- **Templates** are page layouts, giving us a view into how content can possibly be laid out.

  > "Templates are page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate the design’s underlying content structure." [Source.](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#templates)
- **Pages** can be considered full "prototypes" of a design systgem, with real content, images, etc.

  > "Pages are specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like with real representative content in place." [Source.](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#pages)

## Configuration

A small `config.js` file at the root of the project provides basic path settings. Developers are encouraged to edit the Gulp and Webpack files directly to suit their needs.

### Webpack

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) does the heavy lifting of assets compilation and transformation. Webpack allows importing of Sass, images, fonts, and other assets into javascript files, bundling output files like CSS and javascript. Note the two webpack files at the root of the project:

- `webpack.particle.dev.js`: Development settings shared amongst all consuming apps.
- `webpack.particle.prod.js`: Production settings shared amongst all the consuming app.

Each app features three webpack files. Take for example, the `pl` app:

- `webpack.pl.sharedjs`: Config shared by prod and dev
- `webpack.pl.prod.js`: Production-only config merged over the top of `webpack.pl.shared.js` and `webpack.particle.prod.js` (from root)
- `webpack.pl.dev.js`: Development-only config merged over the top of `webpack.pl.shared.js` and `webpack.particle.dev.js` (from root)

You are encouraged to read through all three files to understand how assets are parsed and prepared.

### Webpack dev server

Running `npm start` compiles Pattern Lab, then starts a *hot reloading* webpack dev server, then injects assets into the Pattern Lab. All static html files generated by Pattern Lab will be served at [http://0.0.0.0/pl](http://0.0.0.0/pl) and all modifications to assets on the dependency chain will be automatically injected into the browser. This means that you can work on Sass and javsacript, the bundle will recompile, and the browser will reload rapidly. Pattern Lab html regeneration from Twig file changes triggers a hard-refresh of the Webpack dev server browser.

### Gulp

Gulp 4 is used to run a small set of tasks that can't be accomplished by Webpack alone. Examine `gulpfile.js` for all tasks available. Feel free to edit and add tasks to this file.

Gulp 4 is used and the `npm run` commands above basically trigger gulp without having to install a global dependency. If you want to run specific gulp tasks, run `npm run gulp -- TASKNAME`. The `--` passes whatever comes after to the `gulp` command. Run `npm run gulp -- --tasks` to see the whole list, here's some examples of what you can do:

- `npm run gulp -- --help` - See the help menu
- `npm run gulp -- compile` - Compile Pattern Lab

For more info on Gulp:

- [Gulp 4 Docs](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/4.0/docs)
- [Gulp 4 Readme](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/4.0/README.md)

### Drupal theme config

The Drupal theme config is located at `apps/drupal`. Look for the usual `.info.yml`, `.libraries.yml`, and `.theme` files.

### Pattern Lab config

The Pattern Lab config file is located at `apps/pl/pattern-lab/config/config.yml`.

### Linting

- Javascript: edit `.eslintrc.js` - [docs](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/)
- Sass: edit `.stylelintrc` - [docs](http://stylelint.io/user-guide/)

Both can be disabled per-line if need be.

### IDE/Text Editor Setup

Install an [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) plugin for Particle coding conventions.

- [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
- [JetBrains (*Storm)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7294-editorconfig)
- [Atom](https://github.com/sindresorhus/atom-editorconfig)
- [Sublime Text](https://github.com/sindresorhus/editorconfig-sublime)

## Assets

Assets are "static" files that make up all clientside applications. Examples of static assets are:

- CSS
- Javascript bundles
- .map files for debugging CSS and Javascript
- Font files
- JPEG, PNG, GIF, and SVG images
- favicons

> Assets are compiled to the dist/ folder if they are @import'd in some file within the dependency chain of your app. Only files within dist/ are available to be served to your apps.

### "Dependency Chain"

Particle takes a modern approach to asset management through Webpack. Instead of files spread around a project that have to be referenced individually on the client side, apps now have entry point javascript files that @import dependencies that @import dependencies that @import dependencies and so on.

Using Webpack to **[bundle](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/#creating-a-bundle)** this dependency chain up into as few output files as possible to the `dist/` directory means we have a `source/` (and `apps/`) folder that is structured the way we want to work, with a consistent output.

Consider this dependency chain for the `apps/pl` app:

                                                         <- @protons
                                                         <- jquery
                                                         <- bootstrap/src/js/buttons
                                    <- @atoms/button     <- _button.scss
                                                         <- @protons
                                                         <- jquery
                                                         <- bootstrap/src/js/cards
    apps/pl <- source/design-system <- @molecules/card   <- _card.scss
                                                         <- @protons
                                                         <- bootstrap/src/js/jumbotron
                                    <- @organisms/header <- _header.scss

### Font Icons

Useful for small, frequently used icons that are a single color which is changeable via CSS.

1. Place `filename.svg` in `source/_patterns/01-atoms/icon/svg/`
1. Start up active server with `npm start` or compile via `npm run compile:pl|drupal`
1. View new font icon demo page in Pattern Lab at [Atoms > Icon > Icons](http://localhost:8080/pl/?p=atoms-icons)
1. Use either way:
    - HTML class: `icon--filename`
    - Sass Mixin: `@include icon(filename)`

> IMPORTANT: Font icons are only compiled at the start of a webpack build. The webpack dev server will have to be restarted to see new icons appear in the font.

#### Inline SVG

Useful for larger, less frequently used vector images that potentially could be multi-color or able to animate.

1. Place `file.svg` within a namespaced folder, like `source/_patterns/01-atoms/icon/svg/`.
1. Use the special `_svg.twig` pattern to inline it completely. For instance, using the path in step 1, include it like so:
    ```twig
    {% include '@atoms/image/_svg.twig' with {
      svgpath: '@atoms/icon/svg/file.svg',
    } %}
    ```
1. OR just use the [`source`](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/functions/source.html) function provided by Twig: `{{ source('@atoms/icon/svg/file.svg') }}`

### Static images

Static image notes here.

## Apps

Particle features two "apps" which simply consume the design system in `source/` and then present it according to their needs: a Drupal theme and a Pattern Lab installation.

### Drupal

`apps/drupal/`

(REVAMP) - templates/ - Drupal twig templates. These often will `include`, `embed`, or `extend` the Twig templates found in Pattern Lab like this: `{% include "@molecules/branding/branding.twig" with { url: path('<front>') } %}`. We keep the components in Pattern Lab "pure" and ignorant of Drupal's data model and use these templates to map the data between the two. Think of these as the Presenter templates in the [Model View Presenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–presenter) approach. Also, Drupal Twig templates that have nothing to do with Pattern Lab go here.

#### Drupal integration of design system Twig files

Drupal Twig templates in `templates/` can `{% include %}`, `{% extends %}`, and `{% embed %}` the Twig patterns within `source/_patterns/`. See the [Atomic Design and Namespaces](#atomic-design-and-namespaces) section above for details, but implementing, say, an organism is pretty straightforward:

```twig
{% include "@organisms/path/to/file.twig" with {
  title: label,
  imageUrl: field_name.raw.path,
  largeCTA: true,
} %}
```

(Note: update this) For a demonstration in a sample codebase of how exactly to integrate templates, see the [`drupal-lab`](https://github.com/phase2/drupal-lab) repo; in particular note how both a [node teaser template](https://github.com/phase2/drupal-lab/blob/master/web/themes/dashing/templates/content/node--article--teaser.html.twig) and a [views field template](https://github.com/phase2/drupal-lab/blob/master/web/themes/dashing/templates/views/views-view-fields--newspage--page.html.twig) in the Drupal `templates/` folder can embed the [card template](https://github.com/phase2/drupal-lab/blob/master/web/themes/dashing/pattern-lab/source/_patterns/02-molecules/cards/card.twig) from Pattern Lab while formatting the data.

Better examples coming soon at [Phase2 Frontend Docs](https://phase2.github.io/frontend-docs/)!

### Pattern Lab

`apps/pl/`

Refer to the [Pattern Lab Documentation](http://patternlab.io/docs) for extensive info on how to use it. Particle is a custom Pattern Lab 2 *Edition* that is heavily influenced by the [Drupal Edition of Pattern Lab](https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-php-drupal-standard) and uses the Twig engine to bring it inline with Drupal 8's use of Twig.

The `app/pl` folder simply imports the design system from `source/` and provides its own custom Sass for UI and json generation. Any Twig files that change in `source/` cause a full Pattern Lab rebuild. The Pattern Lab engine and config lives within `apps/pl/pattern-lab`.

#### `Faker` data in Pattern Lab

[`Faker`](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) generates fake data and the [Faker plugin for Pattern Lab](https://github.com/pattern-lab/plugin-php-faker) is used here. This generates *different* fake content for each compile, and allows [translated content](https://github.com/pattern-lab/plugin-php-faker#locales) as well.

**Faker only works in the global data files** found in `source/_data/` currently until [this bug](https://github.com/pattern-lab/plugin-php-faker/issues/2) is fixed.

Use it like this in `source/_data/data.json`:

```json
{
  "description": "Faker.paragraph",
  "text": "Faker.words(3, true)",
  "byline": "Faker.sentence",
  "intro": "Faker.sentences(2, true)"
}
```

The formatters (things like `.paragraph`, `.words`, etc) can accept options, when you see `Faker.words(3, true)` that means give me 3 random words and I'd like them as a string and not an array of strings. All the [formatters and their options are documented here](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker#formatters) - there's tons: numbers, address, names, dates, and more.

### Grav

`apps/grav/`

Grav is a flat file CMS that uses Twig as a template engine. Learn more [here](https://learn.getgrav.org/).

#### Grav integration of design system Twig files

With the inclusion of the Grav plugin, [twig-namespaces](https://github.com/phase2/grav-pl-starter/tree/master/app/user/plugins/twig-namespaces), Grav Twig templates in `templates/` can `{% include %}`, `{% extends %}`, and `{% embed %}` the Twig patterns within `source/_patterns/`. Similar to Drupal above, including these patterns is done as follows:

```twig
{% include "@organisms/path/to/file.twig" with {
  title: label,
  imageUrl: field_name.raw.path,
  largeCTA: true,
} %}
```

Configuration for Grav and additional docs can found at `apps/grav/README.md`.

### Adding or Removing Apps

Particle makes adding or removing apps a snap! By default Particle has Pattern Lab, Drupal and Grav included. But these can be added to, removed or changed easily! If you'd like to make changes, see these pieces:

* `module.exports` in `config.js`
* imports in `gulpfile.js`
* `twigNamespaces` in `gulpfile.js`
* `compile` scripts in `package.json`
* `webpack` scripts in `package.json`
* Special: to remove Grav, delete `particle.yaml`
* Add or delete App folder under `/apps`

## Testing

Particle provides the starting point for various types of testing. Tests are located under the tools directory:

    # ./particle/
    .
    ├── tools/
    │   ├── tasks/
    │   └── tests/
    │   │   └── accessibility/
    │   │   └── unit/
    │   │   └── vrt/
    │   └── ...
    └── ...

### Accessibility Testing

To run [pa11y](http://pa11y.org/) accessibility testing on Pattern Lab rendered output, first you'll need to install the pa11y npm package:

```bash
npm install pa11y pa11y-reporter-cli
```

To save these devDependencies to your project *permanently*, run the following instead:

```bash
npm install --save-dev pa11y pa11y-reporter-cli
```

Then whenever you want to run your tests, simply start the local Pattern Lab dev server in one session:

```bash
npm start
```

And the kick off the pa11y tests in another session:

```bash
npm run test:pa11y
```

See `./tools/pa11y.js` for configuration [options](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y/tree/5.x#configuration). Note the ignore options are for example only, add your needed updates to the options object. Add additional pages to the test via the `testPaths` array.

```js
const options = {
  standard: 'WCAG2AAA',
  ignore: [
    'WCAG2AAA.Principle3.Guideline3_1.3_1_1.H57.2',
  ],
  log: {
    debug: console.log,
    error: console.error,
    info: console.log,
  },
};
```

### Unit Testing

Particle provides unit testing as well using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/tutorial-jquery.html).

Simply run the following to run Jest tests against the design system:

```js
npm run test:unit
```

Note the `__tests__` folders within components for examples.
