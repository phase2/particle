Particle is an opinionated set of tools and examples to:

1.  Build an application-agnostic **design system**
1.  Apply that design system to a locally-served **Pattern Lab** for rapid
    prototyping
1.  Apply that design system to a **Drupal theme**

## Prerequisites

- [Node `^8`, `^10`, `^12`](https://nodejs.org)
- [NPM `^5`, `^6`](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [PHP `^7`](https://php.net)

[Step-by-step instructions to install all dependencies for OSX can be found in this Gist.](https://gist.github.com/illepic/efd6ab9f452af2a99b7ade78257e6b96)

## Provides

- Drupal theme, Grav theme, and Pattern Lab app
- Strict [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) component structure
- Webpack bundling of all CSS, javascript, font, and static image assets for
  multiple targets (Drupal theme, Grav theme, Pattern Lab)
- [Webpack Dev Server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) for local
  hosting and hot reloading of assets into Pattern Lab
- [Twig namespaced paths](https://symfony.com/doc/current/templating/namespaced_paths.html)
  automatically added into Drupal theme and Pattern Lab config. Within any twig
  file, `@atoms/thing.twig` means the same thing to Drupal theme and Pattern
  Lab.
- Iconfont auto-generation
- Auto-linting against the
  [AirBnB JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- All Webpack files are fully configurable
- Simple [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator for Design System component
  creation

## Quickstart

Particle builds design systems in dev mode for local hosting, or production mode
for optimized asset generation.

### Quickstart A

1. Simply run:

   ```bash
   npm create @phase2/particle particle
   ```

1. Then `cd particle/` and run:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Quickstart B

1.  [Download the latest release](https://github.com/phase2/particle/releases)
1.  Extract anywhere (i.e. this readme should be at
    `any/where/particle/README.md`)
1.  Within the extracted folder run:

```bash
npm install
npm run setup
npm start
```

Simply wait until the webpack bundle output appears then visit
[http://0.0.0.0:8080/app-pl/pl/](http://0.0.0.0:8080/app-pl/pl/) (or
[http://localhost:8080/app-pl/pl/](http://localhost:8080/app-pl/pl/)) and start
working.

That's it. For **much** greater detail on the frontend approach using this
project, check out the

## Design System Naming

The Design System Source folder is named default `./source/default`. It's handy
in multi-design setups to name this per design system and post-fix `apps` with
that design system name. For example, `apps/drupal-default/` contains the
implementation of the `default` source directory. These are intended to be
updated by the needs of your project.
